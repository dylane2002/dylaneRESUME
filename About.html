        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
            As a recent graduate with a strong foundation in Computer Programming, I have developed proficiency in languages 
            such as Java, C#, and JavaScript. I have completed various projects that showcase my ability to apply complex algorithms 
            and software engineering principles in real-world applications. My academic experience includes developing an award-winning 
            inventory management system, as well as other web and mobile applications. 
            I am now seeking a full-time position where I can leverage my programming skills and passion to contribute to innovative tech solutions.
